This project explores what affects university students' CGPA based on data we collected ourselves through **face-to-face surveys**. We asked students about their study habits, screen time, sleep, stress, and more â€” then analyzed how these factors relate to academic performance.


## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
Training Data: hfinal.csv
Testing Data: final.csv
Sample Size: 50+ university students
Data was collected in person, ensuring authenticity and diversity across responses.


Each row represents a student. Columns include things like:

* `Exampreperday`: Hours spent preparing for exams daily
* `Studyhoursperweek`: Weekly study hours
* `SGPA` / `PreviousSGPA`: Semester GPAs
* `Weeklyscreentime`: Hours of screen time
* `academicsatisfactionrating`, `Stressrating`, etc.

## What the Code Does

### 1. Load the Data

Reads both training and testing CSVs and stores them as data frames.

### 3. Visualizations

Lots of them:

* **Scatter plots** to see how each variable correlates with CGPA
* **Histograms** to check distributions
* **Boxplots** to catch outliers
* **Pie charts** for categorical variables like stress and relaxation habits
* **Bar plots** for frequency of responses

Plots are grouped in grids using `par(mfrow=...)` for easier comparison.

### 4. Multiple Linear Regression (MLRM)

Builds a model to predict CGPA using:

```r
lm(CGPA ~ SGPA + Weeklyscreentime + academicsatisfactionrating + PreviousSGPA)
```

We check the model summary to find which variables are significant (based on p-values).

Then we use this model to predict CGPAs for new/test data.

### 5. Correlation Matrix

Generates a correlation matrix for all variables, to spot strong/weak relationships.

## Takeaways

SGPA, previous SGPA, and academic satisfaction were the best predictors of CGPA.
Screen time and sleep had weaker but noticeable effects.
Not everything showed a clear trend â€” some results were surprising, which is why we included so many visualizations.

## Why This Matters

We wanted to understand how student habits actually link to performance, based on real data â€” not assumptions. This could help identify what really matters when it comes to doing well academically.
